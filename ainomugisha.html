    <h1>Intoduction</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a cross platform,object-orientedscriptinglanguage. It is a small and light weight language.Inside the host environment(for example,a web browser).JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide progmatic control over them.</p>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,such a ray ,date,and maths,and a core set of language elements such as operators,control structures,and statements.Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing ot with additional objects;forexample:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Client-slide Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its document object model.</li>
        <li>Server-slide JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to learning JavaScript on a server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What you should already know</h2>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background</p>
    <li>A general understanding of internet and the World Wide Web</li>
    <li>Good working knowledge of Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
    <li>Some programming experience.</li>
    <h3>Javascript and Java</h1>
        <p>Javascript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally differnt in some others.The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations.Javascript supports a run time system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,Boolean, and string values.</p>
        <h3>Hello world</h3>
        <p>To get started with writing Javascript,open the scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" Javascript code:</p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName){alert("Hello" + yourName);}greetMe("World");</code>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser</p>
        <h4>Variables</h4>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.The names of variables,called identifiers,conform to contain rules.</p>
        <p>A Javascript identifier must start with a letter,underscore(-),or dollar sign($),subsquent characters can also be digits(0-9).Because Javascript is sensitive ,letters include the characters"A" through "Z"(uppercase)and the characters "a"through "z"(lowercase)</p>
        <h5>Declaring variables</h5>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>With the key word var.For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value.For example</p>
            <code>x=42</code>
            <p>This always declars a global variable.It generates a strict Javascript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. </p>
            <p>With the key word let.For example, </p>
            <code>let y=13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.</p>
